#  Analysis of Titanic Disaster Passenger Dataset using Pandas and Machine Learning Libraries


🌊🚢 **Project Description** 🚢🌊

Over a century has passed since the tragic Titanic disaster, yet it continues to captivate researchers eager to unravel the mysteries of survival and loss. Armed with cutting-edge data analysis and the powerful machine learning arsenal of Pandas and Scikit-learn, I embark on a voyage through a Kaggle dataset. This dataset includes 891 training examples, 12 features, and 418 testing examples, each holding a clue to the fates of those onboard. My quest: to discover the life-saving features, and identify the individuals who survived. ⚓✨
